# APEX Roadmap

## Vision

APEX is a Formula 1 season hub — the next stretch of work grows it from "when's the next race, who's winning" into deeper race analysis (comparisons, strategy, replay) and a few tightly-grounded GenAI features, per the research report from 2026-07-27. Everything ships read-only, free-tier-sourced, and Mongo-cached; no feature gets added by compromising those constraints.

## How this works

Checkpoints (`CP<n>`) number flatly and continuously across the project's life — they never restart per batch. One branch (`feat/<kebab-case>` or `fix/<kebab-case>`) and one PR per checkpoint; branch off `main`, implement, test (`python -m unittest discover tests` from `backend/`; `npm run build && npm run lint` from `frontend/`), verify in the browser, push, wait for the user's merge confirmation before starting the next checkpoint. Batches are small — 2 to 4 checkpoints — and get built, verified, and deployed before the next batch is planned; nothing here commits to building everything at once. `FEATURES.md` is the source of truth for what's actually shipped (its "Known gaps" section is not restated here). `HANDOFF.md` is the source of truth for session-level working memory and gotchas (also not restated here) — this file only tracks the durable plan: vision, batch history, current batch, and backlog.

**Parallelization check, done at batch-planning time:** before starting a batch, check each checkpoint's expected file footprint. Checkpoints that touch disjoint files with no sequential dependency (e.g. Batch 3's weather tile / nav label / telemetry fix) can be built by parallel subagents, each in its own git worktree, with PRs opened and merged independently. Checkpoints that share files or have a real dependency (e.g. two features both touching the Pitwall page) stay sequential — parallel agents on shared files risk merge conflicts and duplicated helpers instead of saving time.

**Skill usage for UI/UX work:** any checkpoint touching visual design, layout, or animation must invoke the `emil-design-eng` skill (animation/interaction polish philosophy — easing, timing, transform-origin, press feedback) before implementing, and `apple-design` when the work involves gesture-driven or physically-feeling interactions. `pick-ui-library` should be invoked before adding any new UI dependency; `review-animations`/`improve-animations`/`find-animation-opportunities` are for auditing existing motion rather than building new UI. These are the only project skills that exist (see `.claude/skills/`) — there is no "ui-ux-pro-max" or "Framer Motion" skill; the app already depends on `motion/react` (Framer Motion) as its animation library, so use it directly rather than introducing a second one. A custom liquid-glass dropdown/popover (`bg-[rgba(26,22,19,0.98)] border border-white/10`, motion-animated open/close, click-outside + Escape handling) already exists in `tire-stints-chart.tsx` and `compare-drivers-panel.tsx` — reuse that pattern instead of a native `<select>`, which does not carry the app's theme.

## Shipped batches

| Batch | Checkpoints | Theme | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | CP1-6 | Perf, circuit images, driver crop, driver modal, season selector, team logos | merged |
| 2 | CP7-14 | Circuit lightbox, schedule/home/standings polish, Pitwall CTA prominence, tyre stints re-sourced from FastF1 | merged |
| 2 (ad hoc) | unnumbered | Pit-stop analysis module (Pitwall), driver-bio rate-limit fix (Hamilton championship undercount) — built mid-batch in response to user requests, outside the original CP15-19 plan | merged |
| 3 | CP20-22 | Weather conditions tile, dynamic nav season label, telemetry error-leak fix | merged |
| 4 | CP23-24 | Driver head-to-head compare, teammate battle panel | merged |
| 5 | CP25 | Lap-by-lap position chart (Pitwall "Lap Telemetry"), plus the compare-drivers dropdown redesign | merged |
| 6 | CP26-28 | Pitwall dropdown click-outside/Escape backport, circuit history panel (closest finish/most wins/first year raced), season-aware page metadata | merged |

The original plan's CP15-19 (driver/team head-to-head compare, championship calculator, lap-by-lap chart, calendar links, global search) were superseded by the ad-hoc work above and never built under those numbers. They're carried forward into the Backlog below rather than left as gaps — checkpoint numbering resumes cleanly at CP20.

## Current batch

Batch 6 is complete and merged. Batch 7 is not yet planned — see Backlog below for candidates.

Batch 6 was built as three parallel worktree agents (CP26, CP27, CP28), each touching disjoint
files with no shared dependency, per this file's parallelization-check convention — all three
opened independent PRs and merged cleanly with no collisions.

**Worktree cleanup note:** two of Batch 6's agent worktrees left their `next dev` processes
running after finishing (verification step didn't tear the server down), which held file locks
that made `git worktree remove` hang for several minutes until the leftover `node.exe` processes
were killed manually. If a post-batch worktree cleanup hangs, check for orphaned dev-server
processes still pointing at that worktree's path before assuming the removal itself is stuck.

## Backlog (unscheduled)

### Comparison & analysis
- Gap-to-leader (seconds) as a Pitwall Lap Telemetry follow-up to CP25's position-only chart
- Championship "Title Decider" scenario calculator
- Circuit similarity / "Circuit DNA" comparison across tracks

### Race weekend enrichment
- "Add to calendar" reminders for sessions
- Functional global search (nav search input is currently dead)
- Team radio moments (text, from OpenF1 race_control)
- F1DB circuit-layout SVGs / team logos to replace incomplete asset host coverage

### GenAI features
- "Explain this session" auto-recap after a race/quali/sprint syncs
- Natural-language query bar (replaces the dead nav search box)
- Race strategy commentary on the Pitwall page (grounded in stint data)
- Driver comparison narrative (pairs with the head-to-head feature)
- "Ask about this circuit" scoped chat (RAG over cached circuit history + Wikipedia extract)
- Pre-race prediction with transparent reasoning (framed as commentary, not a promise)

### Replay & media
- Race replay / session playback (lap-by-lap scrub, timing tower, track status flags)
- Strategy "what-if" pit-stop replay (drag a stop to a different lap, estimate position impact)

### Other
- Personal "watch party" second-screen mode
- Constructor budget cap tracker (manually updated, no live feed exists)
- Fantasy / prediction game (bigger scope — needs auth + persistence; v2 milestone)
